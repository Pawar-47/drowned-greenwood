"""Turn the Phase 0 probe logs into reports/tool_evaluation.md.

Run:
    python tools/phase0/make_report.py --logs "a/phase0_log.txt b/phase0_log.txt" \
        --out reports/tool_evaluation.md

The logs contain two kinds of RESULT lines:
    RESULT <name> exit=<code>                  (shell probes)
    RESULT {"step": "...", ...}                (Python probes, JSON)
Both are normalised into rows so the report reads the same either way.
